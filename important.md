That’s an excellent goal 💪 — becoming an **SDE 1 at Google** is highly achievable if you plan well and stay consistent. Let’s create a **clear, structured roadmap** to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in both **Python** and **Java**, since both are popular languages for interviews.

---

## 🚀 Overview: The Goal

You need to:

1. Build **strong foundations in DSA** and problem-solving.
2. Be comfortable **coding in Python or Java (or both)**.
3. Be able to **solve LeetCode-style problems efficiently**.

---

## 🧭 Phase 1: Foundation (1–1.5 months)

### 📘 Step 1: Language Basics

Choose one language as your *primary* for DSA (I recommend **Java**, since Google interviews often use it). You can use Python for quick prototyping.

**Topics to cover in both:**

* Variables, data types, loops, conditionals
* Functions/methods
* Classes, objects, OOP principles
* Exception handling
* Input/output
* Libraries (e.g., `collections` in Python, `java.util` in Java)

**Resources:**

* *Python*: “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”, official docs
* *Java*: “Head First Java”, official Java tutorials

## 🧮 Phase 2: Core Data Structures (1.5–2 months)

Learn each structure → implement from scratch → solve 10–15 problems per topic.

* **NeetCode.io** → Structured roadmap
* **InterviewBit** → Practice & mock interviews

**Strategy:**

* Solve ~5 problems/day (mix of easy/medium)
* Track patterns: sliding window, two pointers, BFS/DFS, DP
* Learn to identify which data structure fits a problem

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Mock Interviews & System Thinking (1–2 months)

1. **Time Complexity Analysis**

   * Big O notation, Space vs. Time trade-offs
2. **Mock Interviews**

   * Use *Pramp*, *Interviewing.io*, *LeetCode contests*
3. **System Design Basics** (light version for SDE1)

   * Caching, load balancing, REST APIs

* Learn to **communicate your thought process** — key for Google interviews.
* Focus on **medium-level** problems more than hard ones.

Would you like me to turn this into a **weekly study plan (with resources + problem sets)** for 6 months? That way, you can follow it step-by-step toward your SDE1 goal.
